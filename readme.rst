Download the project and open assembler1.html in a browser. Should be relatively self explanatory.

Files.
------
:assembler[1-6].html: These files hold the GUI.
:assembler.css: Style settings for the .html files.
:assembler.js: Adds interactivity to the html files.
:heavycages: This is a JavaScript file which holds an object containing
             the possible cages the user can construct. The cages here
             have carbon atoms replaced with heavy atoms so that the
             visualizer can use color coding to show where the building
             blocks and linkers are.
:optcages: This is a  JavaScript file which holds an object containing
           the possible cages the user can construct. The cages here
           are optimized.
:make_heavycages.py: A Python script which constructs the
                     ``heavycages`` file.
:make_optcages.py: A Python script which constructs the ``optcages``
                   file.
